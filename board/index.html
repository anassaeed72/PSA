<p>I am a senior studying Biochemistry and Public Health. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, reading and spending time with family and friends. I joined PSA because I am proud of my own Pakistani heritage and enjoy sharing my culture, tradition and ancestry with my friends and peers here at the U. My goal is to make PSA more inclusive this year to minority communities and continue to lead a successful organization, committed to providing students a chance to learn and enjoy Pakistani traditions and culture</p>

<p>I’m currently a junior, studying finance and management. I joined PSA because I seek to incorporate the interest of Pakistan among different communities and see its culture grow at the U. In my free time, I enjoy painting, playing badminton, and reading graphic novels. I used to have Kanye’s attitude and Drake’s feelings, but since Kanye is canceled it’s just Drake feelings.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone, I’m currently a PhD candidate in computer science and specializing in Networks under the guidance of Dr Zhi-Li Zhang. And easy way to put it is when you type facebook.com, I make the magic happen. I love traveling and have been to over 35 states (honestly lost count after 20) but what to make it a whole 50. And I did make this website so bugs and hugs are welcome.</p>

<p>I am a junior double majoring in Biology and Spanish Studies. After graduation I hope to attend dental school and become and orthodontist because I love making people smile! My hobbies and interests include makeup, playing the clarinet, baking and decorating cakes, and exploring the world around me. In my time at the U, I’ve had the opportunity to get involved in the multicultural community on campus and it is a community of which I am so grateful to be a part! I joined PSA to celebrate my Pakistani heritage and to hopefully learn Urdu (lol). This year I hope to amplify PSA’s presence on campus and share Pakistani culture with a broad range of people!</p>
